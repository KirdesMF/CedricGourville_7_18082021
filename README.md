If you want to use `docker` dont forget to install it [install docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

and you also need to install `docker-compose` in order to be able to start the project [install docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

`docker` will install all dependencies inside the container

Start docker dev => `docker-compose up -d`

Stop docker dev => `docker-compose down`

The front dev server can also be launch via npm: `npm run dev` but you may need to `npm install` first
